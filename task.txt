Put your front-end skills to the test by building a JavaScript-based interface powered by NASAâ€™s Mars Rover Photos API.

ðŸ”§ Requirements

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Sign up for a free NASA API key at https://api.nasa.gov/

ðŸ“¸ Project Overview
Create a simple yet elegant photo gallery that allows users to search and view images taken by NASA's Mars rovers.

1. Build a Search Form
Design and implement a responsive form that lets users query the photo database.
Required Fields:
  Date range (Earth date â€“ from/to)
  Rover (multi-select)
  Camera (multi-select â€“ include only the 3 common to all rovers)

2. Display Search Results
Once a search is submitted:
  Fetch results from the NASA API
  Render the results in a paginated or lazy-loaded grid
  Each result should include:
  A thumbnail image
  The date the photo was taken
  The name of the rover

3. Full-Size Image View
Clicking on a thumbnail should open the photo in a modal or fullscreen view for a closer look
